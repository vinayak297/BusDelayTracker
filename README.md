# BusDelayTracker
A crowdsourced bus arrival and delay tracking app
# Bus Delay Tracker 🚌

## Problem
Waiting at bus stops is frustrating because buses are often late and there is no real-time information.

## Solution
This app shows:
- Bus expected arrival time
- Delay in minutes
- Live status using backend simulation and crowdsourced input

## Features
- Real-time ETA updates
- Delay tracking
- Crowd confirmation ("Still waiting" / "Bus arrived")

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: Flutter (Android)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: Firebase Firestore

## Status
🚧 Project in progress
